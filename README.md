# Arduino I2C Slave, providing GPS (Serial) and LoRa (SPI) services #

Designed to add peripherals to a Pi without using up any I/O or busses.  So, it is an I2C slave (I2C can have multiple slaves).

Initial use is for my "PaperChase" project (A HAB direction/distance finder for the Pi Zero with PaPiRus 2" display) but there are other uses.
